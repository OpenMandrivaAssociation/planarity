.SH NAME
planarity \- manual page for planarity 2.2.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B planarity
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms
as well as implementations of several planarity-related graph algorithms.
The origin of this project is the reference implementation for the Edge
Addition Planarity Algorithm, which is now the fastest and simplest
linear-time method for planar graph embedding and planarity obstruction
isolation (i.e. Kuratowski subgraph isolation).

The software in this code project provides a graph algorithm framework and
library, including an updated version of the edge addition combinatorial
planar graph embedder and planar obstruction isolator (i.e., a Kuratowski
subgraph isolator). This code project also includes several extensions
that implement planarity-related algorithms such as a planar graph drawing
algorithm, an outerplanar graph embedder and outerplanar obstruction
isolator, and a number of subgraph homeomorphism search algorithms.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
planarity \-s \-q \-p infile.txt embedding.out [obstruction.out]
Process infile.txt in quiet mode (\fI\-q\fR), putting planar embedding in
embedding.out or (optionally) a Kuratowski subgraph in obstruction.out.
.nf
Process returns \fI0\fR=planar, \fI1\fR=nonplanar, \fI\-1\fR=error
.fi
.TP
planarity \-s \-q \-d infile.txt embedding.out [drawing.out]
If graph in infile.txt is planar, then put embedding in embedding.out
and (optionally) an ASCII art drawing in drawing.out.
.nf
Process returns \fI0\fR=planar, \fI1\fR=nonplanar, \fI\-1\fR=error\fR
